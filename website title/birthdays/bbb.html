They can use the natural healing and soothing properties of the Amethyst to bring calm and clarity to difficult situations. They need space and privacy to rest and recharge, so don't mind it. ;)

                    The brilliant, rich and bold Emerald is an ideal stone for those creative and visionary types born in May. Emerald people don't hold back when it comes to what's on their mind, or about what they really want. The deep green of the Emerald is resonant with the explosion of new life and vitality each spring, and anyone who knows an Emerald person knows it's hard to hold them back. But just like spring buds are delicate, Emerald people need the support and encouragement of those around them to fully thrive.</p>

                    Strong, steady and loving, there is something smoothing about the presence of a Taurus. They are one of the most strong-willed and purposeful signs of zodiac, but they also have a serene disposition that puts everyone around them at ease. Taureans are very connected to nature, and they appreciate time in the great outdoors. They are also known for their love of treats, so you can put a smile on their face with a delicious meal or a thoughtful gift. They dislike others putting pressure on them</p>

                    Just like luminous and mysterious Pearl, there is a romantic undercurrent that runs through June people. The Pearl has long been associated with the moon, and just as the moon 🌝 has many phases, so too do June people, who can let their many different ideas or moods lead them in any number of directions. The more pearl people follow the call of the tides of their heart, the happier they are! They are naturally protective, nurturing and generous to those they care about, but may get hurt easily if they feel their kindness is not reciprocated.</p>

But they could be on to something totally different by the next day! This isn't necessarily a sign of flakiness, but rather their vast assortment of interests and passions. They may also have lots of different friends and activities and enjoy bouncing around between them. They are natural communicators and are great people to turn to brainstorm or have a good chat.</p>

They may move towards what they want in a subtle way, or they may wear their heart on their sleeves. But either way, they don't hold back and will reach their goals eventually. Like the bright and passionate Ruby. July people have a zest for life that is contagious.

                    Virgos are patient, considerate and thoughtful, but they also have a mischievous fun side. While they have a strong work ethic and tend to prefer their lives to be orderly and productive, they also know how to let loose and indulge their natural spontaneity and curiosity. They pride themselves on being reliable, so if you make plans with a virgo, yk they will show up on time that they're helpful or preoccupied with others. But it's all just because they want things to go as perfectly as possible.</p>
